##  🧾 1.  Abstract
 Transformers have demonstrated effectiveness in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, extending them to solve PDEs on complex geometries
 remains a challenge. In this work, we propose SpiderSolver, a geometry-aware transformer that introduces spiderweb tokenization for handling complex domain
 geometry and irregularly discretized points. Our method partitions the irregular spatial domain into spiderweb-like patches, guided by the domain boundary geometry. SpiderSolver leverages a coarse-grained attention mechanism to capture global interactions across spiderweb tokens and a fine-grained attention mechanism
 to refine feature interactions between the domain boundary and its neighboring interior points. We evaluate SpiderSolver on PDEs with diverse domain geometries
 across five datasets, including cars, airfoils, blood flow in the human thoracic aorta, as well as canonical cases governed by the Navier-Stokes, Darcy flow, elasticity, and plasticity equations.
 Experimental results demonstrate that SpiderSolver consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across different datasets and metrics, with better generalization
 ability in the OOD setting.
