# Bidirectional Projection-Based Multi-Modal Fusion Transformer for Early Detection of Cerebral Palsy in Infants

##  üßæ 1.  Abstract


Periventricular white matter injury (PWMI) is the most common magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) finding in infants with cerebral palsy (CP). This work aims to detect CP and identify subtle, sparse PWMI lesions in infants under two years old with immature brain structures.

To this end, we construct a multi-modal dataset consisting of 243 cases, each with:
- Region masks of five anatomically defined target areas on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI),
- Lesion annotations on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI),
- Diagnostic labels (CP or Non-CP).

We further propose a **Bidirectional Projection-Based Multi-Modal Fusion Transformer (BiP-MFT)**, which integrates cross-modal features using a novel **Bidirectional Projection Fusion Module (BPFM)** to align anatomical regions (T1WI) with lesion patterns (T2WI).

Our BiP-MFT achieves subject-level classification accuracy of **0.90**, specificity of **0.87**, and sensitivity of **0.94**, outperforming nine competing methods by **0.10**, **0.08**, and **0.09**, respectively. Additionally, BPFM surpasses eight alternative fusion strategies based on Transformer and U-Net backbones on our dataset.

Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed annotation strategy and validate the design of the model components.

### üîß Training

Before training, please modify the following file paths in `BiP-MFT-2D_Infant-PWML-CP/train.py`:

- **`total_path`**: The absolute path to the `BiP-MFT-2D_Infant-PWML-CP/` directory.
- **`pretrained_weight_path`**: The path to the SegFormer weights pretrained on ImageNet-1K (`mit_b1.pth`), which can be downloaded from  
  [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yBVICW9lcDANth-RlwJy1C9M6QNXJ0L2?usp=sharing) or  [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1XiwKp7Ayc81qefs3eu7pGg?pwd=fae8).

- **`data_path`**: The path to the Infant-PWML-CP dataset archive `Infant-PWML-CP.zip` (2.86 GB), downloadable from the same links above.

**Example command for training on Fold 0:**

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python BiP-MFT-2D_Infant-PWML-CP/train.py --w1 0.2 --w2 0.5 --w3 0.1 --w4 0.2 \
  --learn_rate 0.000015 --num_epochs 30 --fold 0 --phi 'mit_b1' --batch_size 5
```
